## A Mechanistic Framework for ME/CFS: Airway Dysfunction and the Pained Gasping Posture Hypothesis

Garett Ridge, 2025

## Introduction

Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME or ME/CFS) is a chronic, disabling illness affecting multiple physiological systems, typically of infectious origin. Numerous outbreaks, often associated with viral epidemics, have been reported throughout the twentieth century<sup><a name="cite1a"></a>[1](#ref1), <a name="cite2a"></a>[2](#ref2), <a name="cite3a"></a>[3](#ref3)</sup>. Despite decades of research and controversy, full understanding of the physiological process remain elusive. In response, this work presents a new hypothesis and model for consideration. As the US Institute of Medicine concluded as recently as 2015, “There is an urgent need for research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ME/CFS”<sup><a name="cite4a"></a>[4](#ref4)</sup>.

ME/CFS is frequently accompanied by a range of related conditions that further complicate diagnosis and management. Among the most prominent are craniocervical instability (CCI) - a disorder involving excessive movement at the junction of the skull and upper spine that can result in disability and neurological symptoms - and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), a disorder marked by inappropriate activation of mast cells leading to episodic allergic and inflammatory symptoms<sup><a name="cite5a"></a>[5](#ref5)</sup>. Other commonly observed comorbidities include autonomic disorders like postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), the connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)<sup><a name="cite6"></a>[6](#ref6)</sup>, and fibromyalgia. These overlapping conditions are not only prevalent among individuals with ME/CFS, but frequently coexist, suggesting the possibility of interconnected underlying mechanisms. The high comorbidity burden in these patient populations highlight the need for a more unified understanding of their pathophysiology.

## Proposed Model

This work proposes a new disease process called Pained Gasping Posture (PGP), as a more direct explanation for the constellation of symptoms seen in ME/CFS. The name evokes the image of someone whose face is frozen in a pained gasp, making the concept vivid and relatable for the public and conveying the seriousness of being trapped in such a state.  The following sections present the evidence and reasoning supporting this explanatory model and invite critical analysis, open scrutiny, and collaborative investigation. To the author's knowledge, this symptom grouping has not previously been explained in such a direct or accessible way, though some elements may reflect misconceptions or overlap with prior findings.

Current scientific consensus holds that ME/CFS is fundamentally a disease of microscopic dysfunction - affecting immune, neurovascular, neuroendocrine, and metabolic pathways. However, these underlying processes do not always clarify how the molecular changes give rise to the diverse, day-to-day symptoms experienced by patients. The PGP model proposed here does not overrule these molecular origins. Rather, it focuses on large-scale physical compensations as a hidden central driver of the lived symptom experience. Specifically, it hypothesizes that a particular, overlooked physical compensation could serve as a mechanistic bridge between the underlying micro-pathophysiology and observable clinical realities of ME/CFS.

In PGP, the hypothesized mechanism of illness involves the pharyngeal dilator muscles exerting excess force to keep an inflamed airway open. Normally, these muscles - controlled involuntarily by the brainstem - maintain airway patency and compensate for swelling without conscious effort or sensation. As inflammation escalates, the muscles may be forced to work harder, but because they are involuntary and provide little sensory feedback and relatively few nerve endings, this excessive strain can remain largely imperceptible to the sufferer. Despite adopting a "pained" neck posture, the person may not feel pain or fatigue in the pharynx itself, and thus would have no obvious reason to suspect this as the source of their symptoms or report it to their clinician. Only when these muscles become overwhelmed and recruit the more perceptible neck and head muscles does discomfort begin, with their posture remaining in spasm for as long as airway relief is needed. This compensatory activity may be externally invisible, depending on the force distribution, leading to unrecognized tissue strain and injury.

Though it may sound simplistic, the causes of PGP together with its downstream effects could account for many symptoms of ME/CFS, along with links to related chronic illnesses such as Cranio-Cervical Instability (CCI) and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) and some frequently correlated traits such as autism.

When someone is frozen in a pained gasping posture, it is typically due to causative factors that match ME/CFS problem areas. Of particulr interest are airway patency issues from pharyngeal inflammation. Viral infections can lead to inflammation or even mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), which particularly triggers throat inflammation due to the abundance of mast cells in the pharynx<sup><a name="cite7"></a>[7](#ref7)</sup>. Swelling of these tissues can be substantial - sometimes enough to threaten airway closure<sup><a name="cite8"></a>[8](#ref8)</sup>. If mast cells are driving the inflammation, similar dysfunction would be expected in other mast-cell rich organs like the heart, and systems where mast cells regulate permeability (the digestive tract, the skin barrier, and the blood-brain barrier)<sup><a name="cite9"></a>[9](#ref9)</sup>, which match ME/CFS problem areas of digestion and cognition. Past viral infection is often linked to ME/CFS onset, and the PGP model frames this as a cascade: mast cell hypersensitivity or other inflammatory conditions trigger long-term pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swelling. Anyone frequently assuming a pained gasping posture (PGP) may be responding to these underlying reasons. If airway inflammation and swelling surpass certain limits, the force needed from pharyngeal and other muscles to keep the airway open can escalate beyond control, recruiting secondary muscles and applying strain to tissue, nerves, and vasculature - even when the overworked muscle state has no external signs.

As with causes, PGP would produce effects that are familiar to ME/CFS patients. Maintaining a pained breathing posture long-term leads to predictable downstream problems: breathing dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, disturbed head and neck posture causing uneven loads and wear patterns on discs and bones, cervical spine strain and Cranio-Cervical Instability (CCI) that disrupt the brain stem and neural roots, vascular pressure reducing the head's average perfusion, and dysautonomia from flexion and constriction of the neck's cranial nerves and the spinal cord. Airway muscle overuse would explain what many ME/CFS patients describe as a mystifying sensation of "air hunger". The strain itself is imperceptible in involuntary throat muscles with few sensory nerve endings, so patients may only recognize symptoms once downstream effects manifest, such as muscle recruitment, neck pain, headache, and exhaustion. Thus the PGP model establishes for diverse symptoms of ME/CFS a long chain of potential causality: starting with viruses, to inflammation or MCAS, to pharyngitis and chronic airway strain, to dyspnea and sleep apnea, to CCI and spinal degeneration, and finally to dysautonomia.

Using PGP to explain ME/CFS seemingly produces a good match, when considering plausible PGP causes and effects together. Expanding on another effect, metabolic disturbance, this too is both present in ME/CFS and expected to arise from several of PGP's traits: dysautonomia, abnormal breathing, and any initial viral inflammation. ME/CFS and POTS patients commonly exhibit metabolic issues of impaired mitochondrial function, reduced oxygenation, and paradoxical findings in the RAAS system (which regulates blood volume and pressure via the kidneys and brain's HPA axis). Recent research identifies gas exchange abnormalities in ME/CFS; patients exhibit inefficient ventilation, breathing more deeply and slowly yet reaching the anaerobic threshold at much lower levels of exertion than healthy individuals. This suggests that metabolic dysfunction and abnormal breathing reinforce each other.  A 2022 study found that surprisingly, hypocapnia (low CO₂) is the most common orthostatic abnormality in ME/CFS<sup><a name="cite10"></a>[10](#ref10)</sup>, occurring even more frequently than POTS - highlighting the central role of metabolic changes and their direct connection to breathing in this disease.

The PGP framing may also help demystify Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM), which is integral to ME/CFS and a required symptom for diagnosis. It suggests that some aspects of PEM could reflect ordinary soreness after overworking the airway-regulating muscles, provoking strain-related systemic effects and the familiar PEM crash. These large-scale compensations might augment the recently documented microscopic basis for PEM - namely, local mitochondrial damage and muscle cell necrosis after exertion. On the treatment side, it may be worthwhile to test whether standard post-workout interventions, such as heat and ice therapy applied to the sore airway muscles, can provide crash relief.

### Challenging Conventional Explanations

The PGP model challenges one particularly widespread belief. Consider that a pained gasping posture can overload cervical ligaments, creating the appearance of CCI on imaging. The common explanation of “lax ligaments” for CCI may be a red herring after all if the tissues are actually stretched in length by hidden muscle tension. Standard imaging does not reveal static forces from muscles, so clinicians may miss this constant overload. Cervical ligaments may not be inherently lax but simply pulled longer by external force, which may be considerable if needed to overcome airway swelling. Even in EDS (connective tissue disorder) patients, pained gasping posture might be the true cause of CCI, with EDS only aggravating the tendency of fragile neck areas to deform under high load.  Publicly influential clinicians who attribute CCI to “tech neck” or screen overuse, like those who blame “lax ligaments,” may be overlooking the real mechanism. While these presumed causes are hard to treat or prevent, MCAS can be present in the same patients, which as an alternative explanation for the symptom cascade offers direct and clear treatment options.

The concept of "functional" craniocervical instability (CCI) has been described in the literature as a form of instability without clear structural or ligament abnormalities, attributed instead to dysfunction in the cervical proprioceptive system and muscle tone<sup><a name="cite11"></a>[11](#ref11)</sup>. While this definition recognizes neuromuscular contributions, it does not encompass the broad symptom range of ME/CFS, nor does it address airway muscle involvement, ligament elongation from chronic muscle spasm, or the recruitment of spinal muscles to support pharyngeal constrictor function. In the PGP model, pharyngeal constrictors, which oppose the dilators as an antagonist pair, may fatigue alongside them. Anatomically, it turns out these muscles are well positioned to recruit the cervical spine’s muscles, as both attach to the skull base and styloid process, and are connected by overlapping fascial planes. This suggests shared tension could strain or straighten the cervical spine as seen in CCI. When CCI sufferers, including the author, notice that moving their most painful neck joint to its extreme causes their airway to shut, it's a suprising moment indicating that their spinal pain is intrinsically linked to airway constrictor activity - a key observation that prompted this entire proposal.

The body typically recruits larger muscles when smaller muscles can no longer meet functional demands, per Henneman's size principle. When pharyngeal constrictors are overworked due to airway inflammation or obstruction, their posterolateral positioning suggests that compensation could plausibly come from the posterior neck muscles that happen to be especially painful in CCI (cervical extensors, suboccipitals, upper trapezius). For dilators, which are positioned more anteriorally, compensation might involve the anterior neck and upper chest muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes, pectoralis minor), potentially shifting breathing from diaphragmatic to chest-dominant. Common compensatory postures for airway issues include head extension (forward head posture or “tech neck”) and neck retraction. Clinicians have observed that in OSA and airway compromise, a variety of accessory muscles are recruited when the primary airway muscles are insufficient<sup><a name="cite12"></a>[12](#ref12)</sup>. The pharyngeal plexus, which innervates the pharyngeal muscles, has branches entering the posterior pharyngeal wall at the C3/C4 vertebral levels, further linking strain in this spinal region to potential airway compromise.  The compression of cranial nerves and the brainstem in CCI can manifest as a variety of ENT-related complaints, including swallowing difficulties, voice changes, and sometimes upper airway obstruction, but the reverse direction of causation (CCI resulting from airway issues) would be a new concept to ENT specialists.

The PGP hypothesis proposes that being trapped in an uncomfortable posture is a central, yet often overlooked, feature of illness.It follows that people with ME/CFS may experience far more chronic pain than is recognized - or even than they themselves realize, since pain has become their baseline - while also explaining the brain fog and concentration difficulties frequently reported. Greater awareness from loved ones and caregivers could be transformative; if they understand that PGP sufferers are constantly carrying an invisible weight of muscle overuse and airway discomfort, they may become more supportive of the person’s need for regular self-care and urgent breaks during every interaction.

### Validation Research Directions and Clinical Interventions

PGP is a highly testable hypothesis. EMG and nerve conduction studies could be performed on the airway muscles of CCI patients to systematically assess correlations with airway inflammation and posture-an approach not yet explored. Data could be gathered linking airway inflammation biomarkers or endoscopic findings with posture and muscle dysfunction. Studies could also determine whether treating MCAS, which often improves other chronic illness symptoms, specifically alleviates postural issues, CCI-related imaging findings, or pharyngeal muscle tension. Additionally, confirmation is needed as to whether CCI patients with more inflamed airways have more obstructive, rather than just central, sleep apnea. These links appear to remain unexplored in current research in any systematic way.

Most people with chronic illness do not exhibit overt, dramatic postures; instead, they adopt subtle, compensatory micro-postures as the body adapts to chronic discomfort-slight forward head tilt, jaw tension, shallow chest breathing, or habitual muscle bracing. These are easily missed in brief clinical encounters. What begins as obvious struggle may, over months or years, become a “new normal” that appears only slightly abnormal to outside observers. Many patients unconsciously socially mask or suppress visible signs of distress, especially if they have a history of being dismissed. Clinical settings lack standardized scales for subtle postural and breathing compensation outside of severe cases like end-stage agonal breathing. Specialists work in silos related to individual organs/systems, often missing the holistic “big picture” of chronic compensatory patterns. Systematic study of subtle PGP could reveal important correlations if clinicians and researchers consistently observed and recorded head, neck, and jaw posture, breathing patterns (chest vs. diaphragm, rate, pauses), muscle tension and recruitment, and patient-reported effort and discomfort.

#### Treatment Protocol

As a framework, PGP introduces new possibilities for clinical treatment and symptom relief. It suggests that treating the underlying inflammation - such as MCAS, when present - could resolve the entire cascade of symptoms. This highlights the importance of avoiding viral transmission in the first place, as persistent inflammatory effects afterwards could instigate a life of pained gasping and health issues. Even if only a subset of ME/CFS cases are ultimately explained by inflammation and PGP, this would represent meaningful progress - much as the recognition of small fiber neuropathy (SNF) has illuminated a lab-testable mechanism to explain substantial portion of fibromyalgia cases.

Expanding on the interventions suggested by the PGP model, standard muscle recovery approaches - such as heat or ice therapy applied to the airway region - might help alleviate PEM in ME/CFS, although this remains untested. The model clarifies why some patients find symptom relief by subconsciously applying gentle, targeted forces to the neck - adjustments which are naturally customized in the moment to help unload fatigued muscles.

Additional interventions for relief are explored in the next section, specialized for helping the commonly related autistic patient group, who often experience ME/CFS and experience it differently.

### The Autism Connection

According to those who have autism, monotropism theory<sup><a name="cite13a"></a>[13](#ref13)</sup> describes the lived experience of autism better than other theories. Monotropism theory states that the difference in autistic perception and thinking comes from a having a narrow window of attention that observes fewer things at once. It is akin to navigating life with a zoomed-in telescope, alongside neurotypicals who have their telescopes turned around backwards for a view that's broad but missing detail. That single executive functioning discrepancy is thought to predict all other traits of autism - sensory, social, and behavioral - resulting in a radically different human life.

A speculative but important extension of the PGP model concerns the higher prevalence of autism and monotropism among the population with ME/CFS and MCAS - a link which must be accounted for<sup><a name="cite14"></a>[14](#ref14)</sup>. MCAS, for example, is well documented as more common in autistic individuals, such that overlap of their mechanisms has not been ruled out. One possibility is simply that MCAS and other chronic illness is severely underdiagnosed in those without monotropism, because they aren't the ones tending to become focused upon individual symptoms. They may experience the symptom cascade but without the awareness to accumulate and communicate specific health complaints as a broader illness profile; either the neurotypical quality of life truly is unaffected by symptoms they don't notice, or else it declines without explanation in a quiet tragic fashion. Undermining the possibility of a hidden but equal attack rate of PGP issues in non-autistic groups is the observation that autistic people often have more difficulty regulating physical needs outside their attention window and thus are the most likely population to neglect airway and posture maintenance whenever hyperfocused on anything besides breathing. In that respect, an overlap of chronic illness mechanisms and autism remains plausible.

A more radical framing for the link would be to hypothesize that painful early-onset illnesses directly contribute to causing the autism. Hypothetically, it seems like brains could restructure in the presence of chronic distracting stimuli like pain, whether or not from inflammatory symptom cascades like painful spasmodic gasping. Lifelong distraction and suffering could plausibly alter executive function to result in hyperfocus (the core trait of autism per monotropism theory) as a way to block out constant pain and restore equilibrium. As Fergus Murray notes, “much of autistic behavior can be seen as attempts to restore some kind of equilibrium.” Distracting pain might drive overactivation of the brain’s Default Mode Network, which in autism and ADHD is known to be more connected and harder to deactivate. In autism, being pulled out of focused attention tunnels is described as being literally painful<sup><a name="cite13b"></a>[13](#ref13)</sup>, supporting the idea that monotropism is an adaptive coping mechanism for living with painful illness. Paradoxically, the same hyperfocal trait that ignores the pain could make individuals more aware of and able to report physical symptoms when one happens to be in focus. While this causal link is highly speculative, it is falsifiable and testable: researchers could search for populations with autism but no inflammation or MCAS (even subclinical), or gather evidence verifying that MCAS onset doesn't occur early enough in development (for comparison, ME/CFS is not innate and typically develops later in life), or investigate whether neuroinflammatory processes or chronic pain can alter executive function networks in animal models or humans. While a causal link may be sensational, it has yet to be checked. It highlights that further investigation is warranted into the neuroimmune interface underlying chronic illness and neurodevelopmental traits.

#### A Monotropism-Informed Treatment Protocol

For autistic patients, the PGP framework offers additional clinical insights and interventions. Because monotropic attention can make it difficult to notice or respond to bodily needs, regular breaks from hyperfocus can help, and the PGP model clarifies which particular needs to attend to (breathing and throat posture) for maximum relief among what can be a bewildering array of symptoms. Remembering to address airway strain is easily forgotten when talking and eating, problematic activities which compete for the same muscles. When a muscle complex completely leaves the attention window it may never be granted proper rest when overused. Full-body activities like yoga or showers could plausibly help redirect focus all around the body to provide muscle breaks. Thought exercises might help to free up the attention to locate everything that hurts, and identify every movement that doesn't hurt.

These interventions of rest might be necessary even right after sleep. Sleep paradoxically feels unrestful or injurious to many ME/CFS patients - a hallmark symptom in diagnosis, in fact. If the PGP model is correct, even sleep may not fully unload the neck due to continued airway needs.

#### Other Subgroup Considerations

It is difficult for explanatory models to generalize ME/CFS across patient subgroups as though a single uniform experience. Multiple explanations may exist; for example, one can imagine a case without viral inflammation where the pharyngeal damage instead comes from snoring of purely anatomical origin, creating a feedback loop that starts PGP and ultimately makes the snoring worse. This aligns with research showing ME/CFS is highly heterogeneous, with diverse comorbidities and triggers; while infection is common, physical trauma, surgery, or stress have also been reported as triggers<sup><a name="cite15"></a>[15](#ref15)</sup>. Fortunately, many subgroups' symptoms and interventions overlap even when underlying mechanisms differ. Sensory disruptions, for example, are not limited to the autistic subgroup but are common across ME/CFS, likely due to overwhelmed central signalling pathways. In addition to the brainstem disruptions of CCI, brain imaging studies in ME/CFS show that patients must recruit more brain regions than healthy controls, straining energy resources leading to fatigue under cognitive or sensory load, such as bright lighting.  This resource depletion may divert neural signaling away from pain, posture, and autonomic regulation - the very systems the PGP model identifies as crucial for symptom control in the context of chronic airway and postural strain. The PGP model is proposed with the hope of offering many such generalizations across subgroups, leaving room for patient subtyping and multiple initiating factors, while offering new explanations and in many cases, possible solutions for the diversity and unpredictability of ME/CFS and its comorbidities.

## Motivation and Historic Context

The history of ME/CFS as a disease demands a more accurate and serious framing. In its early days, before the “CFS” label, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) was recognized as a disabling, post-infectious multi-system illness, with documented outbreaks following various viral epidemics<sup><a name="cite1b"></a>[1](#ref1), <a name="cite2b"></a>[2](#ref2), <a name="cite3b"></a>[3](#ref3)</sup> and formally classified as a neurological disease by the World Health Organization<sup><a name="cite16"></a>[16](#ref16)</sup>. Early research identified immune and metabolic abnormalities and clinical hallmarks such as post-exertional malaise (PEM), neurological impairment, and immune dysfunction<sup><a name="cite1c"></a>[1](#ref1), <a name="cite4b"></a>[4](#ref4)</sup>, cementing the disease’s basis in real physical pathology.

However, this clarity was eroded in subsequent decades of medical policymaking, as ME sufferers faced a historic disservice. As chronic illness claims surged, recurring characters within US and UK insurance industry and their political allies worked to undermine recognition of ME. Documented insurance industry strategy memos described ME/CFS as a major expense and called openly for measures to recast the disease as psychosomatic or behavioral<sup><a name="cite17"></a>[17](#ref17), <a name="cite18"></a>[18](#ref18)</sup>, while leading academics and consultants publicly and privately strategized to “manage” the condition in ways that reduced payouts<sup><a name="cite19a"></a>[19](#ref19)</sup>.

The leading US and UK disability insurance conglomerate, UNUM, hosted a 1994 symposium that described ME/CFS in its program as "the malingerer's charter." Politicized UK public funding bodies followed suit seeking to slash welfare costs. Under guidance of the UNUM employee Sir Simon Wessely, the Department of Work and Pensions funded a conference titled "Malingering and Illness Deception." They fostered new ME diagnostic criteria (such as the Oxford and Fukuda definitions) that removed hallmark features like PEM and excluded all mention of biomarkers or objective clinical signs<sup><a name="cite20"></a>[20](#ref20), <a name="cite21"></a>[21](#ref21)</sup>. Official US and UK guidelines and research definitions soon were also stripped of the objective signs and intentionally expanded to include primary psychiatric cases, diluting ME to a vague diagnosis of unexplained fatigue. The NIH moved their CFS program out of the purview of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, first to the NIH Office of the Director and then in 2001 to the NIH Office of Research on Women’s Health, both at the request of Anthony Fauci. The CDC rebranded ME under a new name, “Chronic Fatigue Syndrome” (CFS).

These redefinitions were not the product of new scientific discovery, but of policy meetings and insurance-funded symposia where the explicit goal was to reduce costs by framing ME/CFS as a psychosomatic or “functional” disorder<sup><a name="cite22a"></a>[22](#ref22)</sup>. An author of the PACE trial, a similarly framed and highly influential work later found to be poorly designed and manipulated, testified in court<sup><a name="cite23"></a>[23](#ref23)</sup> that those petitioning for release of the trial data were "young men, borderline sociopathic or psychotic" who would "attempt to identify and seek out trial participants from anonymized data and do them harm." Amid controversy and pushback, a flurry of articles were published portraying critics and ME/CFS advocates as dangerous radicals<sup><a name="cite24"></a>[24](#ref24), <a name="cite25"></a>[25](#ref25)</sup>. During this period, Sir Simon Wessely - one of the key proponents of the psychosomatic framing - served on the Science Media Centre’s advisory board, an organization that was granted approval power by many UK news outlets over any coverage of ME/CFS<sup><a name="cite19b"></a>[19](#ref19)</sup>.

These campaigns reflect an unfortunate political reality: influential thought leaders who weaponize dishonesty possess both the ability and the tendency to form agile, self-organizing networks, capable of broad dissemination of doubt in order to protect vested institutional interests. In the 1990s, more than half of the CDC’s Congressional research funds earmarked for ME/CFS were secretly diverted to unrelated projects, as revealed by a whistleblower and government investigation<sup><a name="cite26"></a>[26](#ref26)</sup>. A satirical letter mocking ME/CFS patients as malingering welfare queens was spotted in the halls of the CDC and later obtained via FOIA request, pinned on a bulletin board alongside letters from real patients demanding that something be done<sup><a name="cite22b"></a>[22](#ref22), <a name="cite27"></a>[27](#ref27)</sup>.

For decades, patients experienced systemic underdiagnosis, denial of social and disability support, and harm from dangerous therapies<sup><a name="cite28a"></a>[28](#ref28), <a name="cite29a"></a>[29](#ref29)</sup>. Stigma in both public and academic circles was especially acute for women. In 1970 two U.K. psychiatrists re-examined the original Royal Free Hospital outbreak and cited the higher proportion of female sufferers as sufficient evidence of epidemic hysteria<sup><a name="cite30"></a>[30](#ref30), <a name="cite31"></a>[31](#ref31)</sup>. In Europe, these attitudes contributed to high-profile cases of ME/CFS patient abuse and forced institutionalization, including in Denmark, the UK (where a child under Sir Wesseley's care had their spine broken during a test designed to show he was faking illness), Germany, and the Netherlands, where young adults and even children with well-documented post-viral syndromes were removed from their families and subjected to inappropriate psychiatric interventions<sup><a name="cite32"></a>[32](#ref32), <a name="cite33"></a>[33](#ref33)</sup>. These incidents are now widely referenced in biomedical and policy literature.

It took additional decades for ME/CFS patients to regain recognition as pandemic victims in need of medical assistance. Landmark policy changes in 2015 (US) and 2021 (UK) reversed most of their earlier stances on the disease<sup><a name="cite4c"></a>[4](#ref4), <a name="cite28b"></a>[28](#ref28)</sup>, made possible by lifetimes of advocacy and mounting biomedical evidence. Even today, patients suffer from underdiagnosis, outdated policies in many regions<sup><a name="cite29b"></a>[29](#ref29)</sup>, accusations of malingering, and confusion about the disease’s true nature and its multi-systemic impact. In part because standard blood tests and imaging are often normal, ME/CFS is still dismissed by some as a functional or psychosomatic disorder. It was only recently widely accepted that exertion in ME/CFS can cause measurable muscle cell death and mitochondrial damage, on par with what’s seen in some muscle diseases<sup><a name="cite34"></a>[34](#ref34)</sup>. Such findings provide a biological basis for the profound post-exertional malaise and muscle pain that define ME/CFS, ruling out that the illness is simply deconditioning. Continued advances like these will help close the gap between molecular pathology and understanding the full spectrum of patient symptoms.

A better understanding of both lived experiences of patients and the mechanisms of the disease is required to resolve longstanding confusion, inform effective treatments, and prevent repetition of past tragedies. A more intuitive model of the disease process is urgently needed.

## Final Thoughts

ME/CFS affects a large amount of the world population, especially those exposed to the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), an unmitigated worldwide problem better known as "mono." Powerful institutions of late 20th century mostly responded to ME/CFS outbreaks with wagon circling and deflection of responsibility, echoing their earlier neglect of AIDS victims under Anthony Fauci<sup><a name="cite35"></a>[35](#ref35)</sup>. We are now repeating the historic pattern with familiar names, but in the context of a new pandemic. COVID continues to surge in spite of assurances that it is over and comes with no further responsibilities. The assurances and narratives are more intense than ever before, perhaps to offset the reality that the airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus is far more transmissible than any contagion in world history. Officials and influencers minimize the ongoing crisis, leaving outbreak victims in need of answers or support. Even if help comes late, new understanding can still change lives.

While not promising a cure or remission, the Pained Gasping Posture (PGP) model offers a novel, integrative hypothesis for the complex symptomatology of ME/CFS and related chronic illnesses. By linking airway inflammation, muscle compensation, and vascular and neural deformation it reframes these conditions as consequences of chronic, invisible physical strain - rather than mysterious or psychosomatic ailments. The lack of conscious perception of pharyngeal muscles means that both patients and clinicians may overlook airway muscle strain as a central factor, focusing instead on more obvious or secondary symptoms. This model not only clarifies airway and posture as central drivers and mechanisms behind debilitating symptoms but also points to practical, targeted interventions. These include addressing mast cell activation, reducing airway inflammation, and supporting muscle recovery to alleviate symptoms and improve patient quality of life. Further research and clinical trials are needed to validate and refine these interventions, with the hope of transforming care for this underserved population. An estimated eighty million people are living with ME/CFS<sup><a name="cite36"></a>[36](#ref36)</sup>, so the potential for relief is enormous.

### Notes for Patients

MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome) is typically diagnosed by allergists. Diagnosis requires symptoms in multiple organ systems, lab tests, and improvement with medication. Older diagnostic criteria focused on raised serum tryptase levels during symptom flare ups. Newer "consensus 2" guidelines<sup><a name="cite5b"></a>[5](#ref5)</sup> suggest 24-hour urine mediator panels (N-methylhistamine, leukotriene E4, and 11-β-PGF2α) and broader testing.  Academic hospitals may be able to additionally test urinary PGD2 directly, plasma histamine, and occasionally, blood PGD2 and plasma heparin.  All of the tests require actively experiencing peak symptoms at the immediate time of sampling. As one ME/CFS author writes, "In some ways, (MCAS) seems tailor-made for rejection by the medical community. Its proponents claim it can cause virtually every symptom in the book (big red flag), yet it lacks good or even half-good measurable diagnostic markers (bigger red flag). (...) [ Luckily ] treatments are generally cheap and safe – which means doctors can bypass the testing phase and use a response to treatment instead. If a treatment helps, the diagnosis is made"<sup><a name="cite37"></a>[37](#ref37)</sup>.

Treatments for MCAS include avoidance of histamine triggers, H1 and H2 histamine blockers taken together, topical steroids, Zafirlukast (i.e. dedicated mast cell inhibitors), oral Ketotifen (available internationally), low dose naltrexone, DAO enzyme (a nutrient concentrated in pea sprouts), quercetin (a nutrient found in red onions and supplements), and more expensive drugs like biologics. Be aware of predatory markets around MCAS and ME/CFS that have thrived while patients have searched for answers. An ecosystem of multi-level-marketing and overpromising therapies forming around conditions is not a reflection on patients themselves. It in no way affects the seriousness or the genuineness of patients' underlying bodily function changes and pain, but rather only contributes further to the historic atmosphere of patient abuse. Be alert.
